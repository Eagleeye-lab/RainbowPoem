We have gathered here together with one agenda and it is you alone
one agenda and it is you alone
one agenda and it is you alone
Even so
Come we are ready for your presence
Come and change our vision eyes on you
We are desperate hearts are open Jesus come come quickly come.
And this is our prayer
Your kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Come now we're ready Lord
Come now we're open Lord
Come now we're desperate Lord

This is a song
===============
The song that angels sing,
The spell that calls the Gathering.
The magic that might bring
Eternal life, the Gathering.
I see a world in anger,
I see a world in pain.
Each day a different story,
But still the message is the same.
Hard news I set beside me,
Sweet dreams is what I need.
What daylight wants to show me
At night, appears to be insane.
May I ask you in?

Not shure what this is
================
Shall I...
Shall I persuade you?
The song that angels sing,
The spell that calls the Gathering.
The magic that might bring
Eternal life, the Gathering.
My cards, the ones to choose from
The role they play tonight.
Which ones embrace the loved ones?
Which ones will summon for a fight?
Show me your precious darlings
And I will crush them all.
Wave withâ€¦
